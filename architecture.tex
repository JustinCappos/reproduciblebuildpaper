\section{\sysname}
\label{SEC:architecture}

Based upon our observations about the common types of bugs, we designed
\sysname, a system for varying the build environment to uncover bugs.
\sysname is meant to enable us to find the same bugs we would find in the
process of making a reproducible build, but without requiring all the same
effort. ...

it works here well.  I would need to reorder this, but need to see how the rest
of the paper comes together.  For now, let's see how the earlier bits shape
up.}
