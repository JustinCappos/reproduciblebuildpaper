\section{Bugs Found}
\label{SEC:bugs}

This section decribes the flaws found via making software reproducible.  These
bugs are \emph{not} merely situations where reproducibility does not work, but
instead covers (seemingly) unrelated bugs uncovered via this process.

\cappos{likely have a table showing some quantitative data about the bugs.
Hopefully we have at least a few dozen examples.  It would be fine to
categorize and group them it there are too many to list.}

\cappos{General ideas about what was found.  Discussing interesting details of 
most types of bugs.}
