\section{Experiences Making Builds Reproducible}
\label{SEC:experiences}

\cappos{This part of the eval focuses on efforts to make builds reproducible.  
What sorts of flaws were found where?  How were they fixed?   We need to make
most of this quantifiable.  Lots of data about number of packages fixed with
each type of fix.}

\cappos{some anecdotes about fixing bugs / interesting bugs are most welcome.  
This should be appropriately organized.  (I can fix the org later).}

  \caption{\emph{I like to sometimes create figures with fake data so that I 
think through what I want to show before running an experiment that takes 
days.  DEFINITELY LABEL THIS CLEARLY SO IT IS NEVER SUBMITTED.  Look how 
clearly I labeled this as fake data!!!}
